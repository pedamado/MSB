# MSB - Ministry of Silly Brackets

**"And Now for an Interactive Application for Something Completely Roman – Very Naughty Serif Cant Curves! No pixels were harmed in the making of these monumental inscription transitions."**

The **Ministry of Silly Brackets (MSB)** is a pedagogical and design tool created to explore the transition from the vertical stem stroke to the horizontal serif outline in formal Roman lettering.

## **Mathematical Foundation**

The "Brackett" or "Cant" curve is a transitional element that gives Trajan letters their characteristic "swelled" elegance. This app utilizes an exponential decay formula to model this acceleration:

$$y = 10 \cdot 5^{-x}$$

This ensures that the tangent of the transition starts 2pw from the end of the stem stroke and widens smoothly until it flattens completely at the terminal.

## **Key Features**

*   **Responsive Workspace:** A collapsible drawer menu for mobile-friendly use.
*   **Proportional Analysis:** A reference circumference allows users to maintain the 1:1 square ratio (e.g., 10pw height) typical of 1st-century monumental inscriptions.
*   **Canvas Panning:** Right-click and drag to move the viewport, allowing for detailed inspection of large-scale constructions.
*   **Vector Export:** Download your results as a layered SVG for further refinement in software like Adobe Illustrator or Figma.
